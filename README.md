# Dynamic Password Generator (React)

A Dynamic Password Generator built with React that allows users to generate secure and customizable passwords instantly. Users can control the password length and choose whether to include numbers and special characters. The app also provides a one-click option to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

This project demonstrates the use of modern React features such as Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef) and showcases how to build a simple yet practical utility application with a clean UI.
